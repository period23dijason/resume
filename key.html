In an education system that emphasizes standards and high-stakes tests, is
it realistic or even possible to encourage students to think, explore, and
develop their own understanding? Learn how schools can develop a
research-based constructivist model to encourage students to think,
search, and discover—and still have those students excel at the tests.


The New Learning Process covers a fundamental shift in the basic paradigm
of teaching that is required to prepare digital students for 21st century
life. It looks at current teacher practices, and explains how we can teach
effectively in an age when new technologies cascade onto the new digital
landscape at an astonishing rate, and identifies the principles and
processes that transcend these new technologies. You’ll come away with a
clear understanding of how to address learning standards and improve test
scores to meet both curricular goals, and strategies that will prepare
students to meet the new realities of the 21st century.
